This JQuery plugin provides a html5-canvas based dashboard-meter for visualizing typical key values surrounding tasks.

The meter is capable of visualizing 3 dimensions:

  * SIZE/TOTAL/AMOUNT: some absolute figure
    (visualized through the size of the disk)

  * PERCENTAGE: which part of that total is left to do
    (visualized through partial overlay disk)

  * URGENCY: by when the 100% is due
    (visualized through the color of the background)
