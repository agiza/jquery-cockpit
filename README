This JQuery plugin provides some dashboard-meters based on html5-canvas for visualizing 
typical key values in processes. 


[1] The Amount-Progress-Urgency Meter
    For tracking and indicating volme, progress and approaching dead-line for tasks due.

  This meter visualizes the folowing three dimensions:

  * SIZE/TOTAL/AMOUNT: some absolute figure
    (visualized through the size of the disk)

  * PROGRESS/PERCENTAGE: which part of that total is left to do
    (visualized through partial overlay disk of what is done)

  * URGENCY: by when the 100% is due
    (visualized through the color of the background)


  Example use case: Task-list
     today = 23-01
     due 23-01, task 0, open
     due 23-01, task 1, completed
     due 24-01, task 2, open 
  
  Should be fed into the meter as set:
     {"at": "23-01", "work": "1/3", "slack": "0"}
  If task 0 completes: 
     {"at": "23-01", "work": "2/3", "slack": "1"}
  And the day after:
     {"at": "24-01", "work": "0/1", "slack": "0"}


  Data-feed and configuration through data- attributes
     @data-meter='{"at": title, "work": percent/volume, "slack": slack}'
     @data-refresh='{"each": "10m15s957", "uri": uri}'


[2] The Exchange Indicator
    For exhange environments where expected ingest and output can be competing 
    for shared resoures that need to be freed up on the output (leaving) side.

  This indicator tries to visualize the workload, resource-stress and progress 
  of the exchange-process.

  * The workload on "ingest" is indicated through a standing (green) bar, while
    the "output" gets a hanging (orange) bar. The total size from bottom of "out"
    to the top of "in" should be an indication of the full load.
  * Inside this a floating (blue) bar indicates the amount of in/out steps that
    need to exchange resources in the process. (This should always be smaller
    then the smallest of the two bars)
  * Progress on the "in" side is visualized by a pale overlay dropping from the
    top, and vice-versa an overlay growing from the bottom will indicate how much
    of the expected "out" steps have completed.
  * Meanwhile the inner 'resource-exchange' bar will float down into the "out"
    section as the congesting resources have been freed up.  Because of this
    behaviour we get an indication of congestion stress when the pale progress
    "in" bar reaches the blue resource-exchange bar.


  Example use case: Hotel arrival and departure on a certain day.
     arriving today into room 12,13,17,20,23
       already arrived: 17,23
     leaving today from room 05,06,17
       already left: 05,17
     one exchange room: 17 (already available)

   This case would plot this data-set:
     { "in": [2,5], "out": [1,3], "ex": [1,2], "title": "mon\n01-08" }
   Or human readable form:
     { "in": "2/5", "out": "1/3", "ex": "1/2", "title": "mon\n01-08"  }
